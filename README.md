# Raspberry Pi 3B Application Code

## Overview
This repository contains application code for Raspberry Pi 3B that interfaces with an LCD display through I2C and handles GPIO buttons. The application runs automatically after kernel boot and communicates with another Raspberry Pi 4B device through sockets.

## Repository Structure
```
.
├── lcd/          # LCD driver implementation using I2C
├── gpio/         # GPIO button interface implementation
├── socket/       # Socket implementation (contains main.c)
├── Makefile      # Main Makefile for building all components
└── README.md
```

## Building the Application
The provided Makefile generates three executable files:
- LCD driver executable
- GPIO interface executable
- Socket executable (contains main application logic)

```bash
make
```

## Installation
The Makefile installs the generated executables in the `/usr/bin` directory of the rootfs generated by Buildroot. This allows the application to start automatically after the Linux kernel boots.

## Application Components

### LCD Driver
- Implements I2C communication with a 20x4 LCD display
- Handles display initialization and text rendering
- Provides functions for clearing and updating display content

### GPIO Interface
- Configures GPIO pins for button inputs
- Implements button debouncing
- Provides interrupt-based button event handling

### Socket Implementation (main.c)
- Acts as both server and client
- Server: Receives data from Raspberry Pi 4B
- Client: Sends button commands to Raspberry Pi 4B
- Coordinates between LCD display and button inputs
